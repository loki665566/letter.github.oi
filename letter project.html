        The Honourable Minister,<br />Ministry of Education,<br />Garki, Abuja.<br />Dear Sir,
    </p> 
    <font size="5">  <p align=center><b>POOR STATE OF SCHOOLS IN AYOBO</b></p>
        <p align=left>
            <font size="5"> <p><p style= text-indent:3%>I am writing this letter to you to express my disappointment on the poor state f schools in Ayobo area in Alimosho Local Government of Lagos State.</p>

                <font size="5">  <p>     <p style= text-indent:3%>Any of these schools that have suffered neglect for many years now are known to have produced many great people and influential personalities who are now making waves in many walks of life in this country. It is quite disheartening that the neglect suffered by these schools has greatly affected the structures and facilities in the schools. In years past when these schools had good and adequate physical structures, people knew the kind of products that came out and the fame they brought to our local government area.</p>
      
                 <font size="5"> <p>     <p style= text-indent:3%>Part from the dilapidated state of the structures and facilities, many parents have sent their children to private schools where there are adequate infrastructure and well-trained teachers who they believe can give their children quality education. For this reason, government schools in this local government have been experiencing exodus of students to the private schools, thereby leaving government schools scanty.</p>
      
                <font size="5">   <p>     <p style= text-indent:3%> Some years ago, some of these schools performed excellently well in public examinations and extra-curricular activities, but things are no longer the same now due to lack of maintenance of the facilities, inadequate teachers and absence of teaching aids. Even some of the teachers employed in the schools at present do not have time for their students. They report to school at their convenient time and when they eventually come, they dictate notes to the students and go out to engage in other businesses.</p>
      
               <font size="5"><p>    <p style= text-indent:3%>It is unfortunate that all these have really diminished academic strength of those schools and whenever the results are released, about 75% of the students either fail or perform below standard.</p>
      
                 <font size="5">  <p>    <p style= text-indent:3%>Besides, the students that are frequently abandoned in the classrooms without teachers are often found roaming the streets, having formed different gangs that are inimical to their education and future life.</p>
      
                <font size="5"><p>    <p style='text-indent:3%'>Sir, I am pleading on behalf of other people in this local government to take urgent actions to reverse the pathetic situation of schools here. We shall be anticipating a quick and positive response when this letter gets to you Thank you.</p>
                <font size="5">   <p align=right><b>Yours faithfully,</b></p>
                </p>
